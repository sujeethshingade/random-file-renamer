# Random File Renamer

This repository contains a Python script that reads files from a directory, shuffles their order, and copies them to a new directory with renamed filenames in a sequential format.

### How to Use

- Place the files you want to shuffle and rename into the original_files/ folder.
- Execute the script: `python main.py`
- The shuffled and renamed files will be copied to the renamed_files/ directory.
